## How Can I Contribute \?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report to Animosusoft. Following these guidelines helps  
maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:,  
and find related reports :mag_right:.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Animosusoft/WebHealthManagement/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Animosusoft/WebHealthManagement/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* #### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to Animosusoft](http://github.com/Animosusoft/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [WebHealthManagement Issues](https://github.com/Animosusoft/WebHealthManagement/issue) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a  
> new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

* Maintain a high quality project
* Fix problems that are important to users
* Engage the community in working toward the best possible project

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing  
4. <details>
    <summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>
   If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.
   </details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report \?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.* For example, start by explaining how you started Animosusoft, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Atom otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Atom command,and if so which one?  
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).

* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.

* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, **record the GIF with the [Keybinding Resolver](https://github.com/Aninimosusoft/keybinding-resolver) shown**. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.

* **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a [CPU profile capture](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#diagnose-runtime-performance) with your report.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.
